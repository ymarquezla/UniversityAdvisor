## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Application Mistakes
❌ **Missing deadlines** (use calendar + reminders)
❌ **Generic motivation letters** (customize for each university)
❌ **Ignoring language requirements** (get DELE C1 early!)
❌ **Not following instructions** (read requirements carefully)
❌ **Waiting until last minute** (start early!)
❌ **Not proofreading** (spelling/grammar errors = red flag)
❌ **Weak recommenders** (choose people who know you well)
❌ **Copying essays** (plagiarism is checked)

### Strategy Mistakes
❌ **Only applying to REACH schools** (need MATCH + SAFETY balance)
❌ **Only applying to one country** (diversify geographically)
❌ **Ignoring cost** (balance prestige with affordability)
❌ **Not leveraging advantages** (MUST emphasize C1 Spanish, EU citizenship)
❌ **Applying to too many schools** (quality over quantity - 9-11 is enough)
❌ **Applying to too few schools** (6-8 minimum for safety net)

### Financial Mistakes
❌ **Not applying to scholarships** (leaving money on the table)
❌ **Underestimating living costs** (budget realistically)
❌ **Not filing FAFSA** (required for Gilman - $13K possible!)
❌ **Forgetting application fees** (budget €50-€100 per university)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Strong Application Profile = 6-8 Acceptances
**If you follow this strategy**:
- REACH: 0-1 acceptances (out of 2 applications)
- MATCH: 3-4 acceptances (out of 5 applications)
- SAFETY: 2-3 acceptances (out of 3 applications)
- **Total**: 5-8 acceptances out of 10 applications

### Red Flags (If This Happens, Seek Advice)
- 0 acceptances from MATCH schools
- 0 acceptances from SAFETY schools
- Only 1-2 total acceptances

### Best Case Scenario
- Multiple MATCH acceptances = choice among quality programs
- 1 REACH acceptance = bonus prestige option
- 2-3 SAFETY acceptances = peace of mind
