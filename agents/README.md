# Agents

This folder contains AI agents I've created for various tasks.

Each agent has its own subfolder with documentation and code.

## Available Agents

- **financial-aid-advisor-agent** - AI agent for finding scholarships, grants, and optimal loan strategies to fund European education
- **new-agent** - Template for a new AI agent (needs customization)
