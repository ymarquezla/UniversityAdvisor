# University Advisor Agent - Project Memory

## Context

This agent helps Sophia, a student with dual EU-US citizenship, navigate the complex landscape of European undergraduate programs in AI, Data Science, and Data Engineering.

## Key Strategic Advantages

### 1. EU Citizenship (German Passport)
- **Financial Impact**: Saves €40,000-€60,000 vs. international student rates
- **Germany**: €350/year vs. €15,000+/year for non-EU
- **France**: €170-€2,800/year vs. €10,000+/year for non-EU
- **Access**: No visa complications, can work during studies, can stay post-graduation

### 2. C1 Spanish Language Proficiency
- **Unique Advantage**: Opens access to Spain's top universities (UPM Madrid, UC3M, UPC Barcelona)
- **Cost Benefit**: Spanish universities cost €1,200-2,800/year - cheaper than Netherlands (€2,314/year)
- **Prestige**: Can compete for Spain's most prestigious programs in her native language advantage
- **Competition Edge**: Most international applicants lack C1 Spanish

### 3. Trilingual Profile (German + English + Spanish)
- **Rare Combination**: German native + English fluent + Spanish C1 = highly marketable
- **Career Value**: Can work in German-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and English tech ecosystems
- **Application Strength**: Universities explicitly value linguistic diversity

**Profile Assessment:**
- **Strengths**: Trilingual skills, EU citizenship, coding experience

- **Acceptable**: €50,000-€70,000 if exceptional program
- **Avoid**: €80,000+ unless truly elite (PSL Paris level)

**Program Focus:**
- AI & Data Science preferred
- Data Engineering acceptable
- Applied/practical programs valued over pure theory
- Strong career outcomes important

## Key Questions to Explore with Sophia

1. **City Size Preference**: Big city (Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin) vs. smaller university town (Passau, Pamplona)?
2. **Career Goals**: Industry data science? AI research? Tech consulting?
3. **Living Preferences**: Prefer German-speaking environment? Spanish culture? International environment?
4. **Risk Tolerance**: More REACH schools (higher prestige, lower acceptance odds) or more SAFETY (peace of mind)?
5. **Budget Constraints**: Is €50k total a hard limit or flexible for exceptional programs?
