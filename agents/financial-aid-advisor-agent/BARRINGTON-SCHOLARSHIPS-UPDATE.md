## 🎓 WHY LOCAL SCHOLARSHIPS MATTER

Local scholarships like these Barrington awards are often:
- ✅ **Less competitive** (fewer applicants)
- ✅ **More personalized** (know local context)
- ✅ **Better odds** (20-40% win rate vs 1-5% for national)
- ✅ **Stackable** (can win multiple local + national)
- ✅ **Community focused** (they WANT to support Barrington students)

**Don't skip these just because amounts seem smaller!** $1,000-$5,000 scholarships add up fast, and local ones are easier to win.
